The package has reached a level of maturity that it becomes useful to
advanced users of computers. A few features are still missing but some
initial feedback is much welcomed to influence further directions of
the development.

Also I'd very much like to hear from authors of existing blood glucose
level tools if they are interested to incorporate this tool for their
work.  Such would spare me the effort to provide a graphical user
interface myself.

For more details about this package please refer to the package vignette.
